## ðŸŽ“ Introduction

Hi there! My name is **Ilies El Jaouhari**, a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics candidate at [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) in Paris, France. I'm also a Research Assistant at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/)), where I'm investigating the benign overfitting phenomenon in classification models. I'm passionate about finance and data science, particularly in creating robust quantitative models and algorithms for financial data analysis.

I'm intrigued by the potential of innovative statistical and machine learning techniques in uncovering insights into financial markets and devising effective investment strategies. You can find more about my work and experiences below.
